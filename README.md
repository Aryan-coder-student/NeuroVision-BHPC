## 🔍 Problem Space

Brain tumors are a significant health challenge globally, with stark statistics highlighting the need for better diagnostics:

- **India**: 40,000–50,000 new cases annually, with 20% in children and 23% in the 31–40 age group (Indian Society of Neuro-Oncology, National Cancer Registry Programme).
- **Global**: 308,102 new brain tumor cases in 2020, with a 17% incidence increase over the past decade (WHO, International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2022).
- **Survival Rates**: The 5-year survival rate for malignant brain tumors is ~36% (American Cancer Society, 2023).

**Challenges**:
- Limited access to advanced diagnostic tools, especially in resource-constrained regions like rural India.
- High costs and expertise requirements for AI-driven diagnostics.
- Diagnostic delays due to radiologist shortages (e.g., 1 radiologist per 100,000 people in India, IRIA 2022).
