## 🎯 **Project Motivation**  

Brain tumors pose a major global health challenge, especially in **developing nations like India**, where access to **advanced medical imaging and expert radiologists** is limited.  

### 📌 **Why This Matters?**  
📍 **India**: **40,000–50,000 cases annually**, with high rural diagnostic delays (Indian Society of Neuro-Oncology)  
📍 **AI Can Help**: Increases **diagnostic accuracy from 70% to 92%** and **survival prediction from 50% to 83%**  
📍 **Public Access**: No freely available **AI-powered 3D tumor segmentation tool**—NeuroVision changes that!
